01. Clock:

Write a program that prints the hours of the day from 0:0 to 23:59, each on a separate line. The hours should be written in the format "{hour}:{minutes}".

########

02. Multiplication Tabl:

Print to the console the multiplication table for the numbers 1 to 10 in the format:
"{first factor} * {second factor} = {result}".

########

03. Combinations:

Write a program that calculates how many solutions in natural numbers (including zero) the equation has:
x1 + x2 + x3 = n
The number n is an integer and is entered from the console.

########

04. Sum of Two Numbers:
   
Write a program that checks all possible combinations of a pair of numbers in the interval of two given numbers. The output prints which combination is the one whose sum of the numbers is equal to a given magic number. If there is no combination that meets the condition, a message is printed that it was not found.

Input:

The input is read from the console and consists of three lines:

• First line – start of the interval – integer

• Second line – end of the interval – integer

• Third line – the magic number – integer in the interval [1...10000]
Output
One line should be printed to the console, according to the result:
• If a combination is found whose sum of the numbers is equal to the magic number
◦ "Combination N:{sequential number} ({first number} + {second number} = {magic number})"
• If no combination matching the condition is found
◦ "{number of all combinations} combinations - neither equals {magic number}"

05. Travelling:

Annie loves to travel and wants to visit several different destinations this year. Once she has chosen a destination, she will estimate how much money she will need to go there and start saving. When she has saved enough, she will be able to travel.
The console will first read the destination and the minimum budget (decimal number) that will be needed for the trip each time.
Then, several amounts (decimal numbers) that Annie saves by working will be read and when she manages to save enough for the trip, she will leave, and the console should display: "Going to {destination}!"
When she has visited all the destinations she wants, she will enter "End" instead of destination and the program will end.
